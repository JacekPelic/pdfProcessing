October, 2011 Activity Report for the Lamar Fire and Ambulance Services

The big news for October is the return of our Public Protection Classiﬁcation from the ISO. The City of
Lamar has been able to maintain our classiﬁcation of 5 but we are extremely close to a 4 rating. Out of
the 60% needed to acquire a classiﬁcation rating of 4 we have earned 59.45%. The ﬁre department,
water department and 911 center were all evaluated this last spring. All departments have met with Mr.
Dennis Parshley of the ISO to determine what steps can be taken to gather more points in an effort to
bring us up to or past that 60% needed for a classiﬁcation of four. We will continue to work towards that
goal over the next several months.

in other news .....

1. Staff members participated in the annual citywide cleanup day.
2. Eighty ﬁre inspections were conducted in October.
3. Fire department staff members conducted annual ﬁre prevention shows in area schools and

preschools. There were 1,120 children contacted over thirteen shows.

4. Captain Burkhart spent three days servicing and tagging ﬁre extinguishers in all City buildings
(not including those of Lamar Light and Power).

5. Chief Cook and Deputy Chief Leonard provided a talk to the Prowers County Historical
Society discussing the history of the Lamar Fire Department

6. Chief Cook, Deputy Chief Leonard and Captain Burkhart participated in a meeting With the
Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Prowers County Healthcare Coalition

7. Marie Buhrer completed nineteen years of service to the City of Lamar at the ﬁrst of October.
Michell Munoz has been chosen to replace Marie and she's done an outstanding job in ﬁlling
Marie's shoes.

As always, we certainly welcome any questions. comments or visits from the city council, media and
the public in general. You are also welcome to observe our weekly training sessions. Our department
trains the ﬁrst and third Wednesdays each month starting at 7:00 pm. The volunteers business meeting

hesitate to contact me with any questions you may have.

ACTIVITY REPORT

Technical service has been working on our storage solution. We ordered two more SAN units to expand our storage needs. We
also ordered two new switches to upgrade our existing SAN infrastructure. During the setup process a few irregularities were
discovered. We are tasked with minimizing downtime during the migration Our initial plan was to migrate all users to a new
domain as our current one is a mix of Windows 2000 and 2003. Our new servers are 2003 would have limited functionality with
2000 in the domain. We have decided to promote one of our 2003 to the domain instead of introducing a 2008. This process has
set our SAN project back a few. The new server will allow us to move users from our existing servers on the old SAN to the
new SAN. This will also allow us to keep our current trusts with other sewers running databases throughout our domain,

We will be introducing a new email server to our network We had hoped to migrate to the cloud but it wasn’t in the budget.
We then looked to MS Exchange for our mail needs We neither have the server not the money to set up a full Exchange server.
This would give us the functionality that we want such as shared calendars, company-wide email lists as well as web access to
your email. We are looking into alternatives to achieve what we want.

We are working with our vendors to upgrade our soﬁwarei Although there is no ideal time to implement this new version, we
are working with staff to iron out most of the bugs before we go live. We have had two trainings on the new version as well as
two conversions of our data. We currently use one ofthe new modules for our CPT or Cemetery Plot Tracking and have been
fora few months. We are trying to implement the new version of UBS or Utility Billing System but are cautious as this is more
signiﬁcant. There is no good time to do this and there will be issues that arise from the upgrade but we will my to minimize
these and other oversightsi

WATER / WASTEWATER
MONTHLY REPORT — October 2011

WATER RESOURCES

Manzanares Construction Services (Norvell Construction) has completed the sandblasting, and
nearly completed the painting, of the exterior of the 6 million gallon water storage tank. Draining
of the tank will be done the week of November 7‘'1 and work on the interior will begin on
November 15‘“. This project is funded by the 0% ARRA loan and the 2.5% State Revolving
Fund loan that the City received in 2010.

The Engineering Company (TEC) is doing a preliminary design and engineers estimate for a
water main replacement project in the hospital area. If this project ﬁts within the budget of the
available loan funds it could be bid in January 2012.

291 acre feet of carryover Project water was released in October for recharge of the Clay Creek
well ﬁeld. 1585 acre feet of carryover Project water remains in Pueblo Reservoir, as well as the
1600 acre feet allocated in May, for 201 1.

Water Attorney, David Shohet, is continuing work on the City’s water change case. He has now
received comments on the “A” case from all the major objectors and will be working to address
the engineering concerns raised by the objectors and possibly revising the decree. Helton and
Williamsen has proposed meeting with the Division Engineer and possibly the State Engineers
Ofﬁce again, but a date is not been set.
