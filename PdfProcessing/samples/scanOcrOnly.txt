Dear Pete.

Permit me to introduce you to the facility of facsimile
transmission.

In facsimile a photocell is caused to perform a raster scan over
the subject copy. The variations of print density on the document
cause the photocell to generate an analogous electrical video signaL
This signal is used to modulate a carrier, which is transmitted to a
remote destination over a radio or cable communications link.

At the remote terminal, demodulation reconstructs the video
signal, which is used to modulate the density of print produced by a
printing device. This device is scanning in a roster scan synchronised
with that at the transmitting terminal. As a result, a facsimile
copy of the subject document is produced.

Probably you have uses for this facility in your organisation.

Yours sincerely,

W.
